This model is a web-based blood donation emergency response system using JSP, Apache Derby, Apache Mahout, enabling efficient donor matching and hospital recommendation based on collaborative filtering of location, ratings, and proximity, and notifications sent via a Java-based bulk emailing system.
The Blood Bank Management System stores the donorâ€™s information like name, address (geo-location) and their last donated date.

With the help of these details the eligible donors are listed and in case of emergency, i.e., in urgent need of blood, an email is sent to all the eligible donors through this bulk e-mailing technology.
